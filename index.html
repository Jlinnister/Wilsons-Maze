        <h2>The Perfect Maze</h2>
        <p>Not all mazes are created equal. A perfect maze is one in which there are no enclosed areas, no loops and no closed circuits. Perfect mazes are tougher to solve.
           Not all perfect mazes are created equal either. Characteristics that differentiate how they are generated include the algorithm type, the memory and time that it requires,
           whether it is bias-free (randomness) and uniformity (all possible mazes are generated equally). This simulation renders a maze using Wilson's Algorithm, a tree type algorithm that is one of the few ways to create a bias free and
           uniform maze.
        </p>

        <h2>Wilon's Algorithm</h2>
        <p>The creation of the maze utilizes Wilson's Algorithm. Cells in white depict portions of the maze that have been set while the branch in blue represents the current random walk
           attempting to generate the next section of the maze. First, the starting cell is added to the maze (initially colored green). Next, a cell is chosen that is not already part of
          the maze to begin a random walk (shown in blue). This branch randomally selects directions to travel until it has either encountered itself, in which case it will erase the branch
          up to that point and continue randomally branching, or until it has hit a section of the maze. The branch is added to the maze by redrawing the directions into each cell that the branch
          traversed. This is why the rendering is slow to start off when the maze is small. The next branch chooses a vertex that is not already part of the maze until all vertices have been drawn.</p>
